==============================================================================

## Getting Started

AIRCART Openkit is a opensource project to build a similar version of AIRCART by Naver Labs.

Different from exisiting motorized carts controlled by Joystick or etc, 
AIRCART can be controlled much more easily thanks to its intuitive loadcell control system. 

--------

AIRCART Openkit is featured by VESCuino library created by CDI at Naver Labs. 

VESCuino is an arduino library that controls VESC, an opensource motordriver. 
While VESC Uart library does exist, 
VESCuino provides much stronger system including faster communication speed, better user interface, etc.
